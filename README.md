# PermutationGenerator

This project implements a random permutation generator and several algorithms for working with permutations, developed as part of a combinatorics course. The main features of the project include:

Random Permutation Generation: The core functionality generates random permutations of integers (0, 1, 2, ..., n-1), ensuring all possible combinations are covered. The permutations are structured in cycles, and the number of cycles is counted.

Permutation Ranking: Given a permutation, the project can compute its rank (the position of the permutation in the lexicographically ordered list of all permutations) using the factorial number system.

Permutation by Rank: You can obtain the nth permutation (rank-based) from a lexicographically ordered set of all permutations, starting from the first permutation.

Count of Permutation Cycles: A method is provided to count the occurrences of different cycles in randomly generated permutations, with the ability to visualize how often each cycle appears.
